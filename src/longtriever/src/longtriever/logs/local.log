Your link even says it: L = 4pi (R^2)sigma (T^4). Using L, luminosity, as the energy in this problem, you can find the radius R by doing sqrt (L/ (4pisigma (T^4)). Hope this helps everyone. Caroline · 4 years ago4 1 Comment (Stefan-Boltzmann law) L = 4pi*R^2*sigma*T^4 Solving for R we get: => R = (1/ (2T^2)) * sqrt (L/ (pi*sigma)) Plugging in your values you should get: => R = (1/ (2 (11,000K)^2)) *sqrt ( (2.7*10^32W)/ (pi * (5.67*10^-8 W/m^2K^4))) R = 1.609 * 10^11 m? · 3 years ago0 1 Comment Maybe you would like to learn more about one of these?
